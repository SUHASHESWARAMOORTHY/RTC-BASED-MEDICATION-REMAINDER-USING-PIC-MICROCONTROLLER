##The button functionality for setting the alarm in my medication reminder
Center Button → Selects the alarm mode.
Upper Button (Above Center) → Increases the time during alarm setting.
Lower Button (Below Center) → Decreases the time during alarm setting.
Left Button → Moves left while setting the alarm (e.g., switching between hours and minutes).
Right Button → Moves right while setting the alarm.
Bottom-most Button → Confirms and sets the alarm.
